#' The practice culture is composed of the following three sub-scales that are 
#' scored as follows.
#' 1) Improvement and Change Culture
#'     - 1, 6:9, 13:14, 16:17, 20
#'     - Scoring: 25*((q1 + q6 + q7 + q8 + q9 + q13 + q14 +q16 + q17 + q20) -10)/10
#' 2) Work Relationships
#'     - 2:3, 5, 11:12, 15, 21:22
#'     - Scoring: 25*((q2 + q3 + q5 + q11 + q12 + q15 + q21 + q22) â€“ 8) /8
#' 3) Chaos
#'     - 4, 10, 18:19
#'     - Scoring:  25*((q4 + q10 + (6-q18) + q19) - 4)/4
#'     - N.b.: Item 18 (stability) is reverse scored

#' @param df A data frame containing 22 numeric columns and an identifier column.

#'  administered
