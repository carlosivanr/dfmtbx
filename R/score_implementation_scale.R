# Score Implementation Climate Scale %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

# Description:
# This function calculates the average implementation climate scale score for 
# each participant in the PATHWEIGH practice member survey data. Additionally,
# this function will rename the implementation climate scale columns by adding
# an "ic_" prefix to facilitate select(starts_with())
#
# All 6 implementation climate scale questions are scored from 1:5, where 1 ==
# not at all and 5 == to a great extent.
# 
# Inputs: pre-processed redcap data download
# Output: returns a data frame with the average placed immediately after the set
# of 6 implementation climate scale items.
